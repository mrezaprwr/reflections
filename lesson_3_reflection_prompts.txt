How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It might be easier because you don't have to care about committing changes everytime
    and it's also harder since you can't track what are the changes throughout the time.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Changes in a separate branch is useful if you want to add new features but you aren't sure enough
    about it, or you want to fix bugs but don't want to changes the whole original file.
